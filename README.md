# bamazon

* In this CLI application, we created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills we learned in this unit. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

## Instructions

* Run code node bamazonCustomer.js

* Once the code has been ran a table of products will populate. 

* BAmazon will then prompt you to choose an item ID and the quantity you would like to purchase. 

* If the quantity is unavailable it will notify the user and prevent order from going through. 

* If quantity is available it will fulfill the users order and the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity. It will also show the user total cost of purchase.




3 update quantity
4 while loop for total price of purchase
